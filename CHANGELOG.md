# Changelog

## 0.7.38 (pre-release)
- Added a Quick Org Search panel above the area selector that lists every org synced by `@saptools/cf-sync` across regions so users can pick an org by name without first stepping through area, region, and org screens.
- Wired `@saptools/cf-sync` topology into the SAP Tools sidebar with a snapshot push and a refresh after scope confirmation, plus output-channel logs tagged `[topology]` and `[scope]` for visibility into each command.
- Hid the topology panel automatically once a region is selected (or when no `cf-structure.json` snapshot exists) so the legacy area/region/org/space cards stay as the fallback path.
- Validated topology selections against the SAP Tools region catalog and resolved org GUIDs from the cache or live CF API before posting the resolved scope back to the webview.

## 0.7.37 (pre-release)
- Removed the SQL result panel's 250-row render cap so queries display all returned rows in the result table.

## 0.7.36 (pre-release)
- Resolved SQL Workbench manual execution so exact uppercase app table names are schema-qualified against the selected app, matching readable display-name behavior.

## 0.7.35 (pre-release)
- Resolved SQL Workbench manual table execution so lower-case app table references are logged and resolved against the selected app schema before HANA execution.
- Preserved the SQL app-list scroll position when selecting lower apps and when the selected app's table list finishes loading.
- Expanded the Logs and Apps workspace tabs so their main lists use the full available sidebar height.

## 0.7.34 (pre-release)
- Added the missing SAP Help Cloud Foundry extension landscapes `us10-002`, `eu10-002`, `eu10-003`, `eu10-005`, `eu20-001`, and `eu20-002` to the region picker with endpoint coverage.

## 0.7.33 (pre-release)
- Added the `us10-001` Cloud Foundry extension landscape to the Americas region picker with endpoint support for `https://api.cf.us10-001.hana.ondemand.com`.

## 0.7.32 (pre-release)
- Added the `eu10-004` Cloud Foundry extension landscape to the Americas region picker while preserving its Europe (Frankfurt) label and endpoint shape.
- Preserved extension landscape API endpoints such as `https://api.cf.eu10-004.hana.ondemand.com` and restored confirmed `eu10-004` scopes across extension host reloads.
- Added sanitized SAP Tools output logs for CF CLI command execution without logging SAP credentials.

## 0.7.31 (pre-release)
- Expanded the three workspace tabs so `Logs`, `Apps`, and `SQL` divide the full tab bar width evenly after removing Debug.
- Kept the equal-width tab layout in compact sidebars and added e2e layout assertions for full-row coverage.

## 0.7.30 (pre-release)
- Removed the workspace Debug tab from the extension and prototype so the workspace now exposes only `Logs`, `Apps`, and `SQL`.
- Removed the Cloud Foundry debugger service, message bridge, e2e flow, vendoring script, and `@saptools/cf-debugger` runtime dependency from the packaged extension.
- Added focused e2e and manifest coverage to prevent removed Debug UI controls or runtime packaging from returning.

## 0.7.29 (pre-release)
- Reopened saved SQL editor files from their existing workspace file URI instead of recreating an associated `untitled:` document, avoiding `file already exists` errors after save.
- Added e2e coverage for saving an app SQL editor and selecting the same app again without showing a reopen error.

## 0.7.28 (pre-release)
- Fixed successful direct HANA DML callbacks that omit the error argument so `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT` render affected-row/status results instead of generic `hdb exec failed.` errors.
- Kept mutating SQL execution popup-free while preserving sanitized output-channel command logs.
- Isolated e2e VS Code extension hosts with a temporary extensions directory and hardened SQL suggest triggering so unrelated local extensions cannot steal editor focus.

## 0.7.27 (pre-release)
- Changed SQL result metadata to show the resolved table name instead of the app name and removed final `Executed:` timestamp chips from result views.
- Opened app SQL editors with workspace-associated untitled file paths so saving `saptools-*.sql` writes inside the current workspace instead of the filesystem root.
- Executed mutating HANA SQL through direct `hdb` execution without a confirmation popup, rendering affected-row/status results while keeping output logs scrubbed for string literals.
- Updated the SQL prototype, unit tests, and e2e coverage for table metadata, SQL editor save behavior, and direct update execution.

## 0.7.26 (pre-release)
- Added SQL result row hover styling so data rows visibly respond without changing result table sizing.
- Added a right-click result-cell context menu with silent `Copy row object` and `Copy cell value` actions.
- Reused duplicate-safe JSON export keys for row-object copy and logged only copy action metadata, not query result data.
- Updated the SQL prototype, unit tests, and e2e coverage for row/cell context copy behavior.

## 0.7.25 (pre-release)
- Decoded text-like HANA Buffer/LOB result cells as readable UTF-8 text so JSON payloads no longer appear as `0x...` hex.
- Preserved hex rendering for invalid UTF-8 or control-byte binary values to avoid misrepresenting binary data.
- Updated SQL prototype, unit tests, and e2e coverage for readable JSON result rendering and Copy JSON output.

## 0.7.24 (pre-release)
- Removed visible SQL result export/copy feedback text such as `JSON copied to clipboard.` while keeping clipboard and export actions functional.
- Kept SQL result export/copy actions logged to the SAP Tools output channel without rendering transient status messages in the result webview.
- Updated prototype, unit tests, and e2e coverage to verify silent copy behavior while still validating clipboard CSV/JSON output.

## 0.7.23 (pre-release)
- Opened SQL result tabs immediately for manual SQL and table quick-select flows, showing a centered animated loading state before query data returns.
- Added a result export menu with Copy CSV, Copy JSON, Export CSV, and Export JSON actions, backed by CSP-protected webview messaging and output-channel action logs.
- Updated the SQL prototype and e2e coverage for immediate result loading, export-menu visibility, and clipboard CSV/JSON formatting.

## 0.7.22 (pre-release)
- Fixed manual SQL execution for readable table names such as `Demo_App` by schema-qualifying selected-app display references even when the raw HANA name is uppercase-safe.
- Hardened SQL table-reference resolution for quoted schema qualifiers, comma joins, derived-table aliases, CTE references, and ambiguous display/raw table-name collisions.
- Updated prototype/test data so the SQL table list displays `Demo_App` while preserving raw `DEMO_APP`, with focused unit and e2e coverage for selected SQL execution.

## 0.7.21 (pre-release)
- Resolved SQL table display names such as `Demo_App` to schema-qualified quoted HANA identifiers before execution, so selected/manual SQL uses the same app table context as quick `Select`.
- Added output-channel logging for display-name reference resolution and final SQL command shape while keeping string literal redaction.
- Added a direct `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Enter` SQL run shortcut and cleaned Command Palette labels so `SAP Tools: Run HANA SQL` is discoverable without duplicated prefixes.
- Expanded unit, prototype, and e2e coverage for mixed-case table names, selected SQL execution, quick-select schema output, and VS Code command fallback behavior.

## 0.7.20 (pre-release)
- Added a per-table SQL quick-select loading state so the clicked `Select` action shows an animated spinner, remains visible while the query is running, and clears in place after completion.
- Updated SQL table completions to use the same readable display names shown in the Tables list, with matching e2e coverage for the VS Code suggestion widget.
- Kept quick-select UI updates scoped to the affected row/button and added e2e delay coverage for stable loading behavior without re-rendering the table list.

## 0.7.19 (pre-release)
- Reworked SQL result opening so repeated manual queries and table quick-selects reuse an existing editor group instead of creating extra vertical splits.
- Resolved the quick-select source editor from the selected app SQL document so results still target the existing result group even after a previous result webview is active.
- Removed the SQL workbench auto-limit note and suppressed transient `Running SELECT * ...` text while keeping output-channel SQL execution logs.
- Preserved the SQL Tables list scroll position after table `Select` actions and expanded e2e coverage for repeated quick-select layout stability.

## 0.7.18 (pre-release)
- Added a SQL safety guard that automatically appends `LIMIT 100` to manual `SELECT` and `WITH ... SELECT` queries when the user has not supplied a top-level row limit.
- Preserved explicit `LIMIT`, `TOP`, and `FETCH FIRST/NEXT` clauses while ignoring misleading limit text in comments, string literals, quoted identifiers, nested subqueries, and branch-local set-query limits.
- Logged the guarded SQL command shape to the SAP Tools output channel with string literals redacted, and exposed the executed SQL in test mode for e2e verification.
- Added a SQL workbench safety note in the prototype/runtime webview and debounced table search refreshes so typing stays focused with large table lists.
- Hardened SQL, Debug, and workspace-frame e2e assertions; full e2e verifies auto-limit behavior, explicit-limit preservation, stable search focus, and workspace restore after login.

## 0.7.17 (pre-release)
- Removed noisy SQL quick-select success text from the SQL tab and removed the visible `SAP Tools SQL Result` heading from result pages.
- Updated SQL result pages to use VS Code theme variables and content-width result tables so wide schemas and long cell values remain readable with horizontal scrolling.
- Added SQL output logs for open-file, table-load, and quick-select flow, plus tighter unit/e2e coverage for result theming, table layout, and overlay table selection.
- Documented the short prototype/MCP Playwright and e2e test commands in `AGENTS.md`.

## 0.7.16 (pre-release)
- Optimized SQL table-list resize performance by replacing per-row text rewrite/binary-search truncation with cached width measurement and cheap overflow-state toggling.
- Reworked SQL table middle-ellipsis rendering into a fixed head/ellipsis/tail layout so the `…` marker stays visually aligned across rows when space is tight.
- Updated SQL table row layout to use full-width table names and moved the `Select` action into a right-side hover overlay instead of reserving a permanent empty column.
- Expanded SQL e2e assertions to cover narrow-width middle truncation, aligned ellipsis behavior, full-width table names with overlay `Select`, and no text-node mutation churn during resize.

## 0.7.15 (pre-release)
- Reworked SQL table-name fitting so long names measure the available row width after render/resize and only middle-truncate when the full readable name cannot fit.
- Kept the hover-only `Select` action in its own right-side grid column while allowing table names to use the remaining width.
- Added e2e coverage for narrow middle truncation, wide full-name rendering, preserved full display metadata, and non-overflowing table text.
- Synced the prototype cache key and standalone table formatter word list so prototype verification matches extension behavior.

## 0.7.14 (pre-release)
- Improved SQL table readable-name formatting so non-acronym uppercase English segments such as `DEMO_BUSINESSAPP_TEST` render as `Demo_BusinessApp_Test` while configured SAP acronyms remain uppercase.
- Hardened the table-name formatter against low-confidence `wordsninja` splits by rejecting single-letter segmentation and preserving mixed alphanumeric identifiers.
- Reworked SQL table middle truncation so long names render a semantic middle ellipsis without relying on browser tail `text-overflow`.
- Expanded unit and e2e coverage for readable uppercase product segments, 105-table test schemas, search filtering, and visible middle truncation layout.

## 0.7.13 (pre-release)
- Matched the SQL Tables selected database heading typography to table names, including body font, size, weight, and line height.
- Tightened SQL e2e layout coverage so table typography is compared against the visible selected database heading, not only app-list rows.
- Bumped the prototype design CSS cache key so `index.html` reflects the latest SQL typography change.

## 0.7.12 (pre-release)
- Replaced the readable SQL table fixture with a neutral purchase-order sample across the extension, prototype, unit tests, and e2e tests.
- Aligned SQL table-name typography with SQL app-name typography so both use the same body font, size, and weight.
- Extended SQL e2e layout coverage to assert matching app/table font family, size, and weight.

## 0.7.11 (pre-release)
- Added readable SQL table display names for compact SAP/HANA identifiers, using `wordsninja` for segmentation and `change-case` for PascalCase formatting while preserving raw table names for SQL execution.
- Updated the SQL Tables search to match readable display fragments such as `PurchaseOrder` as well as raw table identifiers.
- Vendored `wordsninja` and `change-case` into the packaged extension so `vsce --no-dependencies` builds remain self-contained.
- Added unit and e2e coverage for readable table names, raw identifier preservation, long-name truncation, and quick SELECT behavior.

## 0.7.10 (pre-release)
- Hid SQL table `Select` buttons by default so table names stay visually quiet; the action now appears on row hover or keyboard focus.
- Removed the post-open `SQL file opened for app...` status line from the SQL workbench while keeping error and quick SELECT statuses visible.
- Updated SQL e2e coverage to verify the hover-only table action and the hidden open-success status.

## 0.7.9 (pre-release)
- Improved the SQL Tables panel UX with middle-truncated HANA/CDS table names, preserving both the app/schema prefix and the business suffix while keeping full names available through metadata and accessible labels.
- Fixed the Tables search input losing focus after the first typed character by updating only the table count/list during filtering instead of re-rendering the full SQL workspace.
- Centered the table-loading state with a spinner inside the bounded Tables panel and added deterministic e2e coverage for the loading state.
- Increased table-name vertical padding to improve scanability without breaking the compact 100+ table layout.

## 0.7.8 (pre-release)
- Matched the extension SQL tab to the prototype: the app workbench and Tables panel now render from the initial SQL view and share the remaining height in a bounded 50/50 split.
- Added a Tables search input with the same inline search styling as Logs, compact table rows, and leading truncation for long HANA/CDS table names while preserving full names in titles and accessibility labels.
- Fixed HANA table discovery to query the resolved binding schema instead of relying on `CURRENT_SCHEMA`, with output-channel logging for SQL editor open, table discovery, quick SELECT, and manual SQL execution.
- Expanded SQL test-mode data and E2E coverage for large app lists, 104-table schemas, long table names, hidden/empty/error states, table search, and quick SELECT.

## 0.7.7 (pre-release)
- Split the S/4HANA SQL Workbench tab into an upper app picker and a lower tables panel that lists the selected app's HANA tables, each with a dedicated `Select` button that runs `SELECT * FROM <schema>.<table> LIMIT 10` and opens the result panel.
- Replaced the legacy `ORDER_ID` / `STATUS` / `CREATED_AT` / `AMOUNT` demo preview in the SQL tab so the workbench only renders real apps and real table names supplied by the extension.
- Compacted the SQL result panel for status and error outcomes by collapsing the `App:` and `Executed:` lines into a single ellipsis-truncated line and reducing the page padding to 6px.
- Wired new sidebar messages (`hanaTablesLoaded`, `runHanaTableSelect`, `hanaTableSelectResult`) and an idempotent per-app workbench context map so quick selects reuse the already-resolved HANA connection.
- Extended the SQL workbench unit tests with `quoteHanaIdentifier`, `buildQuickTableSelectSql`, and result HTML layout assertions, and added two e2e tests covering the tables panel quick SELECT and the single-line meta header.

## 0.7.6 (pre-release)
- Fixed `Cannot find module 'safer-buffer'` at runtime by walking the full `hdb` dependency tree and copying every transitive package (including `iconv-lite`, `safer-buffer`, and the optional `lz4-wasm-nodejs`) into `dist/vendor/hdb/node_modules/` during build.
- Added a build-time smoke test in `scripts/vendor-hdb.mjs` that spawns Node to `require` the vendored `hdb` entry and assert `createClient` resolves, so any future missing transitive dependency fails the build instead of shipping broken to users.

## 0.7.5 (pre-release)
- Replaced the `hdbsql` CLI executor with the SAP-maintained `hdb` Node.js driver so HANA SQL no longer requires installing the SAP HANA Client locally.
- Vendored the `hdb` and `iconv-lite` packages into `dist/vendor/hdb` so the `--no-dependencies` packaged extension keeps a self-contained driver.
- Connections now default to TLS (`encrypt`, `sslValidateCertificate`) which matches BTP HANA Cloud requirements out of the box.
- Removed the `sapTools.hanaSqlClientPath` setting, the install-guidance card, the `Download SAP HANA Client` notification, and the `hdbsqlDiscovery` module along with their tests.
- Extended the SQL service tests to cover the new client lifecycle: column-metadata mapping, row-key fallback, affected-row status messaging, auth/connection/SQL/timeout error classification, and statement cleanup on failure.
- Added an e2e regression that asserts the SQL result webview no longer surfaces any legacy `hdbsql` / `hdbclient` / `hanaSqlClientPath` strings.

## 0.7.4 (pre-release)
- Detected the SAP HANA Client automatically when `hdbsql` was missing from `PATH` by probing the default install locations on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- Added the `sapTools.hanaSqlClientPath` VS Code setting so users could pin an explicit absolute path to `hdbsql` when the client lived outside of the standard locations.
- Rendered a dedicated install-guidance card in the SQL result webview when the HANA Client was missing, including the searched paths, the download link, and the setting to configure a custom path.
- Surfaced actionable buttons (`Download SAP HANA Client`, `Configure hdbsql Path`) on the error notification shown after an hdbsql-missing failure.
- Extracted the SQL workbench pure helpers into a dedicated support module and expanded unit coverage across the template, result HTML branches (resultset, status, generic error, hdbsql-missing), HTML escaping, table/keyword filtering, and hdbsql path resolution.

## 0.7.3 (pre-release)
- Reworked SQL tab flow to app-first workbench behavior: click one app to open its dedicated `.sql` editor immediately.
- Added `SAP Tools: Run HANA SQL` command with SQLTools-like keybinding chord (`Cmd/Ctrl+E`, `Cmd/Ctrl+E`) and document-bound execution context.
- Added HANA SQL execution pipeline with single-statement guard, mutating-statement confirmation, connection resolution from CF app env, and table name suggestions.
- Redesigned SQL result webview to table-first UX for query runs, opening a fresh result tab per execution.
- Expanded unit and e2e coverage for SQL workbench flow, command invocation reliability, and result rendering.

## 0.7.2 (pre-release)
- Renamed the 4th workspace tab from `Settings` to `SQL` and turned its placeholder into an interactive SQL integration hub with a three-step explainer and two actions (`Go to Apps tab` and `Open SQLTools in VS Code`).
- Added a new `sapTools.openSqlToolsExtension` webview → extension message and handler that activates the `mtxr.sqltools` extension and opens its activity bar, with a Marketplace fallback when SQLTools is not installed or the command is unavailable.
- Kept the header gear icon and Settings screen labeled `Settings` because they still manage Cache Sync Interval, Sync Status, and Logout.
- Synced e2e expectations to the new tab label and fixed an indentation regression in the region-selector layout test.

## 0.7.1 (pre-release)
- Packaged the `@saptools/cf-debugger` runtime inside the extension so Debug works from the installed `.vsix` without relying on an external `node_modules` tree.
- Added loader coverage that prefers the vendored debugger runtime in packaged builds and falls back to the npm package only in local development.
- Tightened Debug tab e2e assertions around hidden status/error elements and responsive port visibility in narrow sidebars.
- Updated the `index.html` prototype so the Debug layout matches the extension more closely on narrow widths and no longer shows a prototype-only success note for per-app start or stop actions.

## 0.7.0 (pre-release)
- Replaced the placeholder `Targets` workspace tab with a `Debug` tab that lists every started Cloud Foundry app in the confirmed scope.
- Integrated `@saptools/cf-debugger` to open an SSH tunnel to a CF app's Node inspector and attach the VS Code Node debugger automatically.
- Added per-app `Start` / `Stop` controls plus a workspace-wide `Stop all` action and a search input for the Debug tab.
- Surfaced live status transitions (`Starting`, `Tunneling`, `Ready`, `Attached`, `Tunnel closed`, `Error`) and the forwarded local port for each session.
- Added `SAP_TOOLS_TEST_MODE=1` debug runner and debug API fakes so the e2e suite can exercise the full Debug tab flow without real CF infrastructure.
- New unit and e2e coverage for debugger lifecycle, status transitions, error and stop paths, and app search filtering.

## 0.4.0
- Promoted 0.3.0 workspace mapping/search improvements to stable release.

## 0.3.0
- Matched `Export SQLTools Config` button height with `Export Artifacts`.
- Hardened restored workspace flow to rescan service-folder mappings when root folder and apps are restored after reload.
- Matched `Active Apps Log` heading size with `Apps Log Control`.
- Added service search inputs in Logs tab (`Apps Log Control`) and Apps tab (`Export Service Artifacts`) with inline search icons.
- Updated service mapping path column to keep path tail visible under constrained width (front-side truncation).
- Expanded E2E coverage for restored mapping persistence, new search behavior, and UI consistency checks.

## 0.1.0
- Initial project bootstrap with strict quality gates.
