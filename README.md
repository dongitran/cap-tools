## Current Features

- CFLogs bottom-panel view for app log filtering, recent log fetches, live stream state, column visibility, font-size, and log-limit settings.
- Workspace `Logs`, `Apps`, and `SQL` tabs for app logging, local service-folder mapping, service artifact export, SQLTools config export, and HANA SQL workflows.
- S/4HANA SQL Workbench for app-scoped SQL files, HANA table discovery, readable table names, SQL completions, quick `SELECT`, manual execution shortcuts, and CSV/JSON result export.
