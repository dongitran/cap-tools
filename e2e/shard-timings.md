# E2E Shard Timings

Source: GitHub Actions run 27763277570 on 2026-06-18. Durations are Playwright list reporter timings from Ubuntu CI.

The CI workflow reads this table through `scripts/run-e2e-lane.mjs`. When tests are added, moved, renamed, or materially changed, update the seconds and rebalance all 12 lanes.
